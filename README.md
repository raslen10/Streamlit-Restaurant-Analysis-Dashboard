# Streamlit Restaurant Analysis Dashboard

## Project Overview
This project is an interactive **Restaurant Analysis Dashboard** built using **Streamlit**. The dashboard visualizes and analyzes key performance metrics, customer trends, and operational data for a restaurant. It includes:

- Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) such as average order amount, average wait time, and customer satisfaction.
- Distribution of cuisine types and payment methods.
- Analysis of wait times using histograms and box plots.

The dashboard provides actionable insights for restaurant managers to optimize operations and improve customer experience.

## Features
1. **Dark Mode Design**: A visually appealing and modern interface with a dark theme for better usability.
2. **Interactive Slicers**: Filters to explore data based on cuisine type and payment method.
3. **Visualizations**:
   - Pie chart for cuisine distribution.
   - Bar chart for payment method analysis.
   - Histogram for wait time distribution.
   - Box plot for wait times across cuisine types.

## Results and Insights
